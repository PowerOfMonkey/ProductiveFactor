Human Skills,SE.PRM.NENR,"School enrollment, primary (%net)",UNESCO Institute for Statistics ( uis.unesco.org ),"Net enrollment rate is the ratio of children of official school age who are enrolled in school to the population of the corresponding official school age. Primary education provides children with basic reading, writing, and mathematics skills along with an elementary understanding of such subjects as history, geography, natural science, social science, art, and music."
Human Skills,SE.SEC.NENR,"School enrollment, secondary (% net)",UNESCO Institute for Statistics ( uis.unesco.org ),"Net enrollment rate is the ratio of children of official school age who are enrolled in school to the population of the corresponding official school age. Secondary education completes the provision of basic education that began at the primary level, and aims at laying the foundations for lifelong learning and human development, by offering more subject- or skill-oriented instruction using more specialized teachers."
Human Skills,SE.TER.ENRR,"School enrollment, tertiary (% gross)",UNESCO Institute for Statistics ( uis.unesco.org ),"Gross enrollment ratio is the ratio of total enrollment, regardless of age, to the population of the age group that officially corresponds to the level of education shown. Tertiary education, whether or not to an advanced research qualification, normally requires, as a minimum condition of admission, the successful completion of education at the secondary level."
